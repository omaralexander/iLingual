# iLingual

iLingual is a first of its kind language learning app! We're bringing together machine learning and language translation to create a fun new way to learn any language. The process is simple, you either select a photo from your library, snap a photo, or use your camera for real time detection. Then, an AI will predict what it sees, and in a few moments you'll get a translation in both text and speech!

## What's New

Now introducing Video captions! Just enter the URL of any video you found online (Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, etc), select a language to translate it to, and watch as the translation comes rolling in! We can handle almost any video found online, and support more than 100 languages, with more to come. Please note, we currently can only handle videos less than 15MB and 1 min videos.
